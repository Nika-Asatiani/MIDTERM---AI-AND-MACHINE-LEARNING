Part 1: Linear Regression and Correlation Analysis

This is part 1 of the repository. The goal is to calculate and understand correlation and linear regression. I wrote a Python script that shows both manual and automatic calculations. The work is simple to repeat and the answers are clear in the code and in the console output.

The x and y coordinates were taken manually from this website:
max.ge/aiml_midterm/652847_html

The script does the following steps:

Calculate the mean of x and y.

Calculate covariance and standard deviation.

Calculate Pearson correlation manually.

Interpret the correlation as strong, moderate, or weak.

Use scipy linregress to calculate slope, intercept, correlation, p-value, and error.

Compare manual and automatic results.

Plot the scatter data with the regression line.

Save the figure as regression_plot.png in the same folder.

To reproduce the work you need Python 3 with matplotlib, numpy, and scipy installed. Run the file regression_analysis.py in PyCharm or from the command line. The console will print the calculations and the figure will be saved as regression_plot.png.
